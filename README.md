# 🧠 **Assignment 2 Report: Data and Task Parallelism for ML Applications**

---

## 🎯 **1. Objective**

This assignment implements and compares **data parallelism** and **task parallelism** in **machine learning applications**.
We applied these concepts to two problems: **Sentiment Analysis** and **Fraud Detection**.

The goal is to analyze how **GPU acceleration** and **CPU multithreading** can reduce execution time while maintaining model accuracy — compared to traditional sequential execution.
